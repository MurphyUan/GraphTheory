# GraphTheory Main assignment

This Repository has been made for the purposes of the submission of the project for Graph Theory. Inside this project are two jupyter notebooks that document findings on topics: The Heap Sort Algorithm and The Isomorphic Graph Problem.

### Heap Sort jupyter nodebook

In order for the successful operation of this notebook the operator must have the latest release of anaconda3.

If the operator wishes to only view the findings they can navigate [here](https://github.com/MurphyUan/GraphTheory/blob/main/heap-sort.ipynb). 

### graph-isomorphism jupyter notebook

In order for the successful operation of this notebook the operator must have the latest release of anaconda3 aswell as the following packages installed in their python packages:
- NetworkX
- Numpy
- MatPlotLib
- Itertools
