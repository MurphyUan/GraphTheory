    "The Graph Isomorphism Problem determines whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. When two graphs are isomorphic the sets of elements are identical. This requires that are no unpaired elements in either set, this is known as a Surjective property, and that elements from one Graph are not paired with the same element, this is known as an Injective property. When these properties are combined it is called a Bijective property.\n",
