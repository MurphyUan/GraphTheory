    "The Heap Sort Algorithm is a comparative sorting technique, where we take an *array* of information we want to be stored \n",

    "For Demonstration purposes our array will be : 4 8 6 7 3 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "As a **Binary Heap Tree (BHP)** of the array looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "          4(0)\n",
    "         /     \\\n",
    "       8(1)    6(2)\n",
    "      /     \\     \\   \n",
    "    7(3)   3(4)   1(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to Heap Sort this **BHP** we want to first get the max-heap of this array. What do I mean by this, I want the array so \n",
    "that its parent node is *greater than* its subsequent child nodes, Like the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "           8(0)\n",
    "         /     \\\n",

    "      /     \\     \\   \n",
    "    4(3)   3(4)   1(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we recursively compare the child node to its parent and we swap the nodes if the *child is greater than the parent*.\n",
    "If there is any change in the *parent* nodes than we perform the action again from the beginning. When *no change occurs* we assume that the node at the head of the **BHP** is the largest node in the **Heap**, We pop that node off the list and try again until there are no nodes left on the Heap. We are then left with an *array of nodes* that are sorted from lowest to highest\n",

To navigate to parent nodes we simply divide the total number of nodes (*in the case of a remainder we remove it* (**floor**)) in the heap and subtract by 1. This always leaves us with the right-most parent node. We then compare each parent node with their children which leaves us our **Max-Heap**. \n",
